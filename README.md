PowerModelsGMD.jl (abbr. PMsGMD) is an open-source framework that provides extensions to [PowerModels.jl](https://github.com/lanl-ansi/PowerModels.jl) (abbr. PMs) for power system simulation, to evaluate the risks and mitigate the potential effects of Geomagnetic Disturbances (GMDs) and E3 High-altitude Electromagnetic Pulse (E3 HEMP) events on the power grid.

PMsGMD solves for quasi-dc line flow and ac power flow on a network subjected to Geomagnetically Induced Currents (GICs). It solves for mitigation strategies by treating the transformer overheating problem as an optimal transmission switching problem.
Since it is open-source, it is easy to study, verify and customize its operation to best fit an application environment. Due to its speed and reliability, it is suitable to be a key component of frameworks that monitor GMD manifestations in real-time, that predict GICs on the power grid, that assess risk, that enhance reliability by providing aid to system-operators, and that recommend modifications in the network configuration.
Thus, PMsGMD is equally useful for research and industry application.



## Core Problem Specifications

* GIC DC: quasi-dc power flow
* GIC -> AC - OPF: sequential quasi-dc power flow and ac optimal power flow
* GIC + AC - OPF: ac optimal power flow coupled with a quasi-dc power flow
* GIC + AC - MLS: ac minimum-load-shed coupled with a quasi-dc power flow
* GIC + AC - OTS: ac optimal transmission switching with load shed coupled with a quasi-dc power flow



## Installation

Prerequisite:
To use PMsGMD, the installation of PMs is required. Follow instructions [here](https://github.com/lanl-ansi/PowerModels.jl).


Installation:
From the Julia package manager REPL type
```
add https://github.com/lanl-ansi/PowerModelsGMD.jl.git
```

Testing:
```
test PowerModelsGMD
```



## Quick Start

The most common use case is a quasi-dc solve followed by an AC-OPF where the currents from the quasi-dc solve are constant parameters that determine the reactive power consumption of transformers on the system.

```
using PowerModels; using PowerModelsGMD; using Ipopt
network_file = joinpath(dirname(pathof(PowerModelsGMD)), "../test/data/epri21.m")
case = PowerModels.parse_file(network_file)

optimizer = with_optimizer(Ipopt.Optimizer)
result = PowerModelsGMD.run_ac_gmd_opf_decoupled(case, optimizer)
```



## Function Reference
<!-- 
1) check that the test datasets correspond to those used in the test cases
-->


### GIC DC

Solves for steady-state dc currents on lines resulting from induced dc voltages on lines.
`run_gmd("test/data/b4gic.m", optimizer)`

For large systems (greater than 10,000 buses), the Lehtinen-Pirjola (LP) method may be used that relies on a matrix solve instead of an optimizer.
This may called by omitting the optimizer parameter
`run_gmd("test/data/b4gic.m")`

To save branch currents in addition to bus voltages
```
setting = Dict{String,Any}("output" => Dict{String,Any}("branch_flows" => true))
run_gmd("test/data/b4gic.m", optimizer, setting=setting)
```


### GIC -> AC-OPF

Solves for the quasi-dc voltages and currents, and uses the calculated quasi-dc currents through transformer windings as inputs to an AC-OPF to calculate the increase in transformer reactive power consumption.
`run_ac_gmd_opf_decoupled("test/data/b4gic.m")`


### GIC + AC-OPF

Solves the quasi-dc voltages and currents and the AC-OPF concurrently. The dc network couples to the ac network by means of reactive power loss in transformers.
`run_ac_gmd_opf("test/data/b4gic.m")`

This formulation has limitations in that it does not model increase in transformer reactive power consumption resulting from changes in the ac terminal voltages.
Additionally, it may report higher reactive power consumption than reality on account of relaxing the "effective" transformer quasi-dc winding current magnitude.


### GIC + AC-MLS

Solve the minimum-load shedding problem for a network subjected to GIC with fixed topology.
`run_ac_gmd_ml("test/data/case24_ieee_rts_0.m")`


### GIC + AC-OTS

Solve the minimum-load shedding problem for a network subjected to GIC where lines and transformers can be opened or closed.
`run_ac_gmd_ots("test/data/ots_test.m")`

Mitigating transformer overheating is achieved by treating the problem as an optimal transmission switching formulation.
However, actual observed GMDs show time-varying behavior in ground electric fields both in magnitude and direction, which could cause different transformer heating than observed in the field peak magnitude.  
Thus, the problem is extended to a multi-time-series formulation as well, in which the physics of transformer heating over time are modeled and used to inform a new optimization model that mitigates the effects of heating in terms of the thermal degradation of the transformer winding insulation.



## Data Reference

PMsGMD uses several extensions to the PMs data format to provide input for its problem formulations.
For generality, it uses a separate dc network defined by the `gmd_bus` and `gmd_branch` tables.
To correctly calculate the increased reactive power consumption of each transformer, the `branch_gmd` table adds all winding configuration related data. Furthermore, `branch_thermal` table adds thermal data necessary to determine the temperature changes in transformers.
The `bus_gmd` table includes the latitude and longitude of buses in the ac network for use in distributionally robust optimization or for convenience in plotting the network.

The description of B4GIC, an included four-bus test case is presented below to demonstrate the use of the PMsGMD data format and introduce each input fields.
